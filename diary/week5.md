Week4: Documentation Log

## Done
* Integrate Istio with Cluster. The integration part is done (not pretty though) but I haven't made istio communicating with cluster yet (sidecar injection)
* Started to read about microservices/eda and combining it with istio.
* Report writing

## Problems
* Network issues still reamins which limits the location where I can develop at (home). I have ordered an external wifi adapter that should fix the problem.
* Having trouble to spin up Istio with cluster preconfigured with .yaml and .gotmpl files (helm/tiller and helm charts). Environment and dependency issues arises. Until solution have been found I integrate istio after that the cluster have been deployed.

## TODO
* Inject istio as sidecar with the cluster and get some minimal tracing outputs.
* Eda architecture + istio
* Report. Prepare for peer review 1.
