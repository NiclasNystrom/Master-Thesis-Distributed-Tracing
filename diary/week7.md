Week7: Documentation Log

## Done
* Peer Review 1
* Report
* Some issues with istio. 


## Problems
* New issues emerged when solving issues from last week. Mainly proxy issues where I have to direct each pods sidecar-proxy (istio ingress) to the main proxy (nginx ingress). I have found some documentation on the web of similar issues so it should be solved in due time even though it's bothersome and unfamiliar.
 


## TODO
* (v2) Fix remaining issues and modify some test agents in order to attempt to trace them.
* Eda architecture + istio
* Report
